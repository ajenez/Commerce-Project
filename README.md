# Commerce-Project
Basic commerce site developed with Python, HTML, and CSS, using Django Framework

This project is a commerce site where users have the ability to register, login, view all current listings made by themselves or other users,
create a listing (which can include uploading an image file), view individual listings, bid on each listing as well as comment, and add listings to a watchlist

Personal Favorite Code Block - This required me to handle a variety of post requests that added rows to the database and find solutions that would lead me to the correct topbid and topbidder handling different possibilities for each along the way

Extra:
This was my first time using Django's Modelforms and it was really interesting discovering how they work and the power that Django has right out of the box!
